      <p>Weakness of attitude becomes weakness of character, the hardest thing in the world is to understand the income tax. Imagination is more important than knowledge, science without religion is lame. Religion without science is blind, I never think of the future. It comes soon enough. The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing.</p>
      <p>Science without religion is lame. Religion without science is blind, E=mc².</p>
      <p>The eternal mystery of the world is its comprehensibility, I want to know God's thoughts; the rest are details. I never think of the future. It comes soon enough. Weakness of attitude becomes weakness of character.</p>
      <p>The only thing that interferes with my learning is my education, any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent, great spirits have often encountered violent opposition from weak minds, the eternal mystery of the world is its comprehensibility. Weakness of attitude becomes weakness of character.</p>
      <p>The secret of creativity is knowing how to hide your sources, the eternal mystery of the world is its comprehensibility. Imagination is more important than knowledge, reality is merely an illusion, albeit a very presistent one, I never think of the future, it comes soon enough.</p>

      <p class="column column-7-of-8-desktop column-7-of-8-tablet column-7-of-8-phone">When the poet Paul Valery once asked Albert Einstein if he kept a notebook to record his ideas, Einstein looked at him with mild but genuine surprise. "Oh, that's not necessary," he replied. "It's so seldom I have one."</p>

      <p class="column column-7-of-8-desktop column-7-of-8-tablet column-7-of-8-phone">So Einstein was wrong when he said, "God does not play dice." Consideration of black holes suggests, not only that God does play dice, but that he sometimes confuses us by throwing them where they can't be seen.</p>
